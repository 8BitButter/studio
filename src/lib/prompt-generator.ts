  if (outputFormat === 'csv') {
    prompt += `Provide the result in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. This format is suitable for import into spreadsheet software like Excel or accounting software like Tally.
- **Headers:** The first line MUST be a header row. The column names in the header should exactly match the "Details to Extract" listed above, in the same order. If no specific details were listed, use appropriate, descriptive headers based on the extracted information.
- **Data Rows:** Each subsequent line should represent a distinct record or item found in the document.
- **Field Order:** Maintain the order of fields in each row as listed in the "Details to Extract".
- **Missing Data:** If a value for a specific detail is not found or is not applicable for a record, leave the field blank but RETAIN THE COMMA to ensure correct column alignment. For example, \`value1,,value3\` if the second value is missing.
- **Special Characters:** Ensure that any commas or newline characters within a data field are properly handled for CSV format (e.g., by enclosing the field in double quotes: \`"field, with comma"\`). Double quotes within a field should be escaped (e.g., \`"field with ""double quotes"""\`).
- **Example CSV Output Structure (illustrative, actual headers will depend on your "Details to Extract"):**
  \`\`\`csv
  ${allDetails.length > 0 ? allDetails.join(',') : (firstPrimaryGoal?.suggestedDetails?.map(d=>d.label).join(',') || 'Header1,Header2,Header3')}
  ${allDetails.length > 0 ? allDetails.map((_, i) => `record1_value_for_detail${i + 1}`).join(',') : (firstPrimaryGoal?.suggestedDetails?.map((d,i)=>`record1_val_for_${d.label.substring(0,5)}`).join(',') || 'record1_val1,record1_val2,record1_val3')}
  ${allDetails.length > 0 ? allDetails.map((_, i) => i === 1 ? '' : `record2_value_for_detail${i + 1}`).join(',') : (firstPrimaryGoal?.suggestedDetails?.map((d,i)=> i === 1 ? '' : `record2_val_for_${d.label.substring(0,5)}`).join(',') || 'record2_val1,,record2_val3')}

  \`\`\`
  Invoice Number: INV-123
  Vendor Name: Acme Corp
  Total Amount: 100.00
  \`\`\`

  prompt += `\n### 4. Formatting Rules & Handling Data
- **Dates:** If extracting dates, format them as YYYY-MM-DD unless explicitly stated otherwise in the "Custom Instructions".
- **Amounts/Numbers:** If extracting monetary values or numerical data, provide them as raw numbers (e.g., 1234.50 or 1234). Do not include currency symbols (like $, â‚¬) or thousands separators (like commas in 1,234) unless required by "Custom Instructions" or the output format explicitly (e.g. for human readable lists, currency symbols might be ok if specified in custom instructions, but for CSV, raw numbers are usually better).
- **Text Cleanup:** Strip any leading/trailing unnecessary whitespace from extracted text values. Ensure newlines within a field value are handled appropriately for the chosen output format (e.g., typically escaped or removed for CSV single line records, but might be preserved in bulleted list outputs).
- **Multiple Records:** If the document appears to contain multiple distinct records or items relevant to the Primary Goal (e.g., multiple line items in an invoice, multiple transactions in a statement), ensure each is processed and represented separately according to the Output Format chosen (e.g., a new row in CSV, a new distinct section in a list).
